# Deep Learning Models for Text Classification
[![TeamCity CodeBetter](https://img.shields.io/teamcity/codebetter/bt428.svg)](yuhui-lin.github.io)

This repository contains several Deep learning models for text classification implemented in TensorFlow.

## Reqirement
* Python 2.7
* Numpy
* TensorFlow r0.8

guide to install Tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html

cnn-character contains the cnn-character and cnn-recurrent model
cnn-word contains the cnn-word model as described in the paper

Because of the allocation of work, the sturcuture is strange. Sorry if you find it incovenient.

Please go into their subdirectory and check their specific README for how to run it.

DONOT run it under this directory
